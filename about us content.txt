The Beginnings of a Beautiful Loaf Story

Seduced by the alluring aroma and tantalising taste of freshly baked designer bread, one woman dreamt of creating a boutique bakery filled with the most divine selection of gourment breads, delicate pastries and sublime sweets.
With a knack for baking and a passion for pleasing, she set out to turn her culinary dream into a palate-pleasing reality. Each offering is a little work of culinary art made from the finest, freshest ingredients with every crumb is crafted with heart and soul.

Thus, A New Star - BreadStory - Was Born To the Culinary World.

Today, BreadStory continues to create its unique brand of lip smacking masterpieces to thrill and win over the masses. Each delightful creation is presevative-free, lovingly crafted and baked in three-hour cycle to ensure quality and freshness.
That's why it's no suprise that BreadStory has become a truly flavosome success story. It now has 21 outlets in Malaysia, 2 in Kuwait, 8 in Indonesia, and 2 in Sydney, Australia. The next roaring chapter of BreadStory is set to unfold in Pakistan, Bangladesh, United Kingdom and hopefully United States.
